# MultiStainDeepLearning
This is the Github Repository providing an example code base for **"The AImmunoscore â€“ Multistain deep learning for prediction of prognosis and therapy response in colorectal cancer"** by Foersch et al. (and other projects using multiple input data). This repo is under construction / development and should be used for editorial and review purposes only. Furthermore, the content of this repo (including  the code, the example data, the repo license, etc.) maybe subject to changes in the future. For further questions feel free to inquire about this project to our group [here](mailto:sebastian.foersch@unimedizin-mainz.de?subject=[GitHub]Multi%20Stain%20Deep%20Learning).
## Introduction
An introduction into the concept of the study and using multiple input data (such as images of different immune cell subtypes) will appear here.

## Requirements
A list of the necessary packages and hardware components used in the study will appear here.

## How to use the code
A step-by-step explanation on how to use the code, including example data, the necessary config and csv files, etc. will appear here.

## How to cite the paper
The reference on how to cite the paper will appear here after acceptance.
